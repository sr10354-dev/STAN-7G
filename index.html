    <h1>MY FAVOURITE HOBBIES</h1>
    <h2>GOLF</h2>
  <p>I like to play golf because its relaxing and im quite good at it.<br>
  I play golf at the Royal golf club of Bahrain and I have lessons there.<br>
  I have been to many golf clubs like  Pebble Beach Golf Links,Torrey Pines Golf Course,Royal Portrush Golf Club and The Bluffs Grand Ho Tram Strip.<br>
  <i>DID YOU KNOW</i>  Golf was banned three times in 15th-century Scotland because it took young men's attention away from archery practice.</p>

    <h2><strong>GAMING</strong></h2>
    <p>After School if I don't have any activities I will go to my pc and play games like cs2,fortnite,minecraft,call of duty or clash royale.<br>
    I usually play for like an hour and then I go outside or edit a video to post on my youtube channel.<br>
    <i>DID YOU KNOW</i>, The first electronic computer system, ENIAC, weighed over 27 tons and occupied about 1,800 square feet.</p>

<h2>TENNIS</h2>

    <p>During the week I like to have tennis lessons and on the weekend I play with my dad.<br>
        I think tennis is really fun and intresting because you have to regulate how hard you hit the ball and how much spin you add.<br>
    when I play tennis I think its a fun way to exercise and test your limits also to have competitions against family and friends.<br>
    <i>DID YOU KNOW</i>  Early tennis (12th century) was played with bare hands, then gloves, in France as jeu de paume (game of the palm).</p>
